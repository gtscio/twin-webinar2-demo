# Data Space Connector 

Materials for the second TWIN Webinar

This folder contains:

* [data-space-connector-test-server](./data-space-connector-test-server/). It contains a custom REST Server based on the TWIN Node base libraries.
It could not be needed if you use a [TWIN Playground](https://github.com/twinfoundation/playground).

* [data-space-connector-app-blueprint](./data-space-connector-app-blueprint/). It contains a blueprint of a Data Space Connector App that can solve the three way document sharing educational case. Using this blueprint actors could customize their own Data Space Connector App to fulfill their role within the case considered. Please note that the current Data Space Connector implementation (at the time of writing) has not yet integrated the [TWIN Rights Management components](https://github.com/twinfoundation/rights-management) or authentication using OpenID. That is still work in progress.
